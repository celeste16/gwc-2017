  <Br> About Me </Br>
    Are you going on vacation constantly working long days, or simply not able
    to give as much attention to your dogs as you like?

       Dog land is here to help?

   I will see to it that your baby receives personalized attention in my care. If im pet sitting
   at your house i will be sure to keep things tidy. ( special request such as; watering plants,
   bringing in the mail, taking out the trash, etc... additional $5.00 charge)

   I look forward to working with your pets because I'm pet lover too. I have over 6 years experience with dogs. So
   I am very confident I can provide the best care for your pet. I look forward from hearing from you.
